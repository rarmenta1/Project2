        Hello, my name is Rafael Armenta and I am a first year ITM major. I like to hang out with friends, play video games, learn about hardware and coding, and sleeping.

    <h2>Things I like to watch</h2>

    <img src="images/strangerthings.png" alt="Stranger Things logo">
    <p>I don't watch a lot of movies or tv anymore and I am not that into anime but here are some things I enjoyed watching or just getting into:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Death Note</li>
      <li>Dragon Ball</li>
      <li>Jojo's Bizzare Adventure</li>
      <li>Logan</li>
      <li>Marvel Movies</li>
      <li>My Hero Academia</li>
      <li>Naruto</li>
      <li>Star Wars</li>
      <li>Stranger Things</li>
      <li>The Boys</li>
      <li>The Office</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As of right now, Jojo's Bizzare Adventure is my favorite one. Jojo's Bizzare Adventure is about the Joestar family, with each part focusing on a different 
        member of the Joestar family. The Joestars mostly use supernatural entities known as "Stands" to fight other Stand users like a Vampire, ancient humanoids, 
        a mafia boss, and even the president of the United States (a fictional one). The reason why I love Jojo so much is that I just love the idea that almost 
        anyone can have a stand and there are some pretty cool and creative stands that I was just eager to learn more about and I really like the characters. I 
        started watching Jojo in high school and has become special to me because it got me through some things. Now Jojo is not for everyone, and I would not 
        recommend watching it as a first anime, I heard that some people did not like the art style or found it too boring which is completely understandable. 
        Regardless, I really enjoyed watching Jojo so much that I started reading the manga because it has not been animated yet and I wanted to read parts 6-8, 
        and part 7: Steel Ball Run is my favorite one to date.

    <p>
        I really enjoy playing video games, and even though I do not have enough time to play them anymore, it is my favorite thing to do. When I have time I either play 
        online with friends or play a single-player game. I can't decide what my absolute favorite games are so here is a list of some of my favorite video game series:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Devil May Cry</li>
      <li>Dead by Daylight</li>
      <li>Fighting games in general</li>
      <li>Final Fantasy VII (Original and Remake)</li>
      <li>Grand Theft Auto</li>
      <li>Mario</li>
      <li>League of Legends</li>
      <li>Pokemon</li>
      <li>Sonic</li>
      <li>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</li>
      <li>The Legend of Zelda</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        One of my favorite types of video games is fighting games. While I may not be that good at them, I try to get better, and even though it can be frustrating
        at times, I enjoy playing them. I love how not only do I need to have quick reactions but I also have to pay close attention to my opponent's habits. Also 
        compared to games like League of Legends, Overwatch, and CSGO, I enjoy having that 1-on-1 face-off. When you win it feels so satisfying because unlike team 
        games in a fighting game you earned that victory yourself. You outplayed your opponent. Also, I just like executing combos because they look so cool and 
        flashy at times. The fighting games I would like to get better at are: Dragon Ball Fighterz, Mortal Kombat 11, and Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I would like 
        to compete in tournaments but right now I am focusing on getting better online not only because of COVID but because I want to get a little bit better before
        I start competing.
