			<h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
			<p class="intro">
				Welcome to my page. I do not have much experience with html but so far I am loving it. It does not feel as overwhelming as java and I really enjoy working
				on html. I am looking forward to learning more this semester and hoping it just gets better from here. The resume page is...well my resume. Now that I look 
				at my resume I think I need more experience and I should really do some more volunteer work. It was a great experience and should do it again sometime. The 
				About Me page is basically about the shows, music and video games I like.Anyways here are some pictures of my dog, Pinky.

			<h2 id="sub-heading">Pinky:</h2>
			<p>
				Pinky is 8 years old and in case you were wondering, Pinky is a boy. He seems to be mistaken for a girl because of his name. The thing with his name is
				that we just kept the name his previous owner gave him. I had Pinky since I was in like 5th grade so I basically grew up with him. 
				
				Anyways, he can be a troublemaker and a handful but I still love him.
